### Reporting bugs

If you think you have found a bug in Sofie, we appreciate bug reports as GitHub issues.

As a minimum a bug report should include the following:

1. **Steps to reproduce:** a detailed description of what input or interaction caused the problem you are experiencing. This will help us greatly in reproducing the error situation ourselves, so that we can observe and analyze the problem.
2. **Expected behavior or result:** Following the steps given, what was it that you expected to happen?
3. **Actual behavior or result:** Following the steps given, what was it that actually happened?

Feel free to include additional information if you have it.

Issues should be reported in our main repository: [https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/issues](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/issues)

### Contributing code
