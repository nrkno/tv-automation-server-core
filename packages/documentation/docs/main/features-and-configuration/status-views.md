Sofie Core can send messages to external systems \(such as metadata, as-run-logs\) while on air.

These messages are retained for a period of time, and can be reviewed in this list.

Messages that was not successfully sent can be inspected and re-sent here.



## User Log

### Columns, explained

#### Execution time

The execution time column displays **coreDuration** + **gatewayDuration** \(**timelineResolveDuration**\)":

* **coreDuration** : The time it took for Core to execute the command \(ie start-of-command ðŸ º stored-result-into-database\)
*  **gatewayDuration** : The time it took for Playout Gateway to execute the timeline \(ie stored-result-into-database ðŸ º timeline-resolved ðŸ º callback-to-core\)
* **timelineResolveDuration**: The duration it took in TSR \(in Playout Gateway\) to resolve the timeline

Important to note is that **gatewayDuration** begins at the exact moment **coreDuration** ends.  
So **coreDuration + gatewayDuration** is the full time it took from beginning-of-user-action to the timeline-resolved \(plus a little extra for the final callback for reporting the measurement\).

#### Action

Describes what action the user did; e g pressed a key, clicked a button, or selected a meny item.

#### Method

#### Status

The result of the operation. "Success" or an error message.
